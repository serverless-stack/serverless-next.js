This repo is forked from [serverless-next.js](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js). Changes are made to the `core` and the `lambda-at-edge` packages to work with [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack)'s [NextjsSite construct](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/NextjsSite).
